# Admin Bar Gone (WordPress Plugin)
This <b>Plugin</b> lets you disable the <b>Black Bar/Admin Bar</b> up top from the <b>Front-End</b> of your <b>WordPress</b> website, whenever admin logs into the admin dashboard after that if you visit your website you'll see the <b>Black Bar/Admin Bar</b> which is not that useable & the disadvantage of having it enable is you could have issues during the development specially the hearder of your website so I've create this <b>Plugin</b> which comes handy for me, fell free to use it for yourself on your websites.
